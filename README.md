# lexprogram
lex based word chain :This project demonstrates the use of Lex, a compiler design tool, to build a Word Chain Game. Lex is used for efficient tokenization, input validation, and state management, showcasing its applications in parsing and pattern matching as part of a compiler design course project.
# Lex-Based Word Chain Game

This project is a lexical analyzer-driven **Word Chain Game** built using **Lex (Flex)** and **C**. It demonstrates how compiler tools can be used to create interactive, real-time applications with proper input parsing, token recognition, and state management.

## ðŸ§  Features

- âœ… Multiple Game Modes:
  - 2-Player Mode
  - Player vs Computer Mode
  - Timer Mode (20 seconds per turn)
- âœ… Dynamic turn handling
- âœ… Dictionary validation for words
- âœ… Duplicate word detection
- âœ… Commands: `pause`, `resume`, `end`
- âœ… Modular Lex + C integration

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- **Lex (Flex)**: Used for pattern matching, token recognition, and state transitions.
- **C Language**: Used to implement core game logic, dictionary handling, turn switching, and timer control.

## ðŸ’» Running the Project

### Requirements:
- Lex (Flex)
- GCC Compiler
- Windows or Linux (for `conio.h` and `unistd.h` compatibility)

### Steps:

```bash
flex cd.l         # Generates lex.yy.c
gcc lex.yy.c -o word_chain -lfl
./word_chain      # Run the game
